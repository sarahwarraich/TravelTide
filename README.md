'Travel Tide,' has launched a project aimed at creating loyalty perks tailored to our clients. Weâ€™ve developed various perks and aligned them with user groups that are most likely to find them appealing. The main focus of the analysis is on segmenting customers using criteria such as demographics, travel preferences, and booking behaviors. The goal is to analyse their interest/behaviour and boost the chances of them enrolling in our rewards program. This report highlights the insights gained from data analysis done mainly in SQL and Tableau.
